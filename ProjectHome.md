_Design_, _prototype_ and _develop_ an autonomous aerial vehicle system, allowing experimentation with real-time control and computer vision algorithms

**Philosophy**
  * make robotics and embedded control accessible and fun
  * stimulate cross-field learning and collaboration
  * leverage modularity and reuse to get more done, quicker

**Technical goals**
  * develop generalised physics model for eg computing optimal PID controlled motor outputs
  * decouple high-update-rate sensors from lower-rate output control
  * employ OpenCV for visual tracking/SLAM/feature detection
  * build lean tracked (land) vehicle
  * build lean quad-rotor (air) vehicle
  * use a shared, modular code-base and electronics platform ([Beagle](http://beagleboard.org/) and [IGEPv2](http://www.igep-platform.com/))
