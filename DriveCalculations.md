Selection of the propeller and motor was optimised for the following factors:
  * excellent efficiency at hover, ie ~175g thrust per motor
  * thrust headroom for aggressive maneuvering, ie >3x hover thrust
  * good efficiency at high-throttle, ie >2x hover thrust
  * constrained motor and propeller weight

Converged selection of 850Kv motor and 9"x4.5" propeller gave:
  * 6.8g/W or 79.8% drive efficiency is realised at high throttle
  * >7.5g/W or >90% drive efficiency is realised at hover
